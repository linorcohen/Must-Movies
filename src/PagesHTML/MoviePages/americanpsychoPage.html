            <p class="movie_storyline">It's the late 1980s.
                Twenty-seven year old Wall Streeter Patrick Bateman
                travels among a closed network of the proverbial beautiful people,
                that closed network in only they able to allow others like themselves
                in in a feeling of superiority. Patrick has a routinized morning regimen
                to maintain his appearance of attractiveness and fitness.
                He, like those in his network, are vain, narcissistic,
                egomaniacal and competitive, always having to one up
                everyone else in that presentation of oneself, but he, unlike the others,
                realizes that, for himself, all of these are masks to hide what is truly
                underneath, someone/something inhuman in nature. In other words, he
                is comprised of a shell resembling a human that contains only
                greed and disgust, greed in wanting what others may have,
                and disgust for those who do not meet his expectations and
                for himself in not being the first or the best. That disgust
                ends up manifesting itself in wanting to rid the world of those
                people, he not seeing them as people but only of those characteristics he wants to rid.</p>
